    "\n",
    "1. For an unweighted graph, DFS traversal of the graph produces the minimum spanning tree and all pair shortest path tree.\n",

    "2. **Detecting cycle in a graph**: A graph has cycle if and only if we see a back edge during DFS. So we can run DFS for the graph and check for back edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Path Finding**: We can specialize the DFS algorithm to find a path between two given vertices u and z.\n",
    "   - Call DFS(G, u) with u as the start vertex.\n",
    "   - Use a stack S to keep track of the path between the start vertex and the current vertex.\n",
    "   - As soon as destination vertex z is encountered, return the path as the\n",
    "     contents of the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Topological Sorting**: Topological Sorting is mainly used for scheduling jobs from the given dependencies among jobs. In computer science, applications of this type arise in instruction scheduling, ordering of formula cell evaluation when recomputing formula values in spreadsheets, logic synthesis, determining the order of compilation tasks to perform in makefiles, data serialization, and resolving symbol dependencies in linkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To test if a graph is **bipartite**: We can augment either BFS or DFS when we first discover a new vertex, color it opposited its parents, and for each other edge, check it doesnâ€™t link two vertices of the same color. The first vertex in any connected component can be red or black!\n",

    "6. Finding **Strongly Connected Components** of a graph: A directed graph is called strongly connected if there is a path from each vertex in the graph to every other vertex.\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. Solving **puzzles with only one solution**, such as mazes. (DFS can be adapted to find all solutions to a maze by only including nodes on the current path in the visited set.)"

    "\n",
    "3) **Crawlers in Search Engines**: Crawlers build index using Breadth First. The idea is to start from source page and follow all links from source and keep doing same. Depth First Traversal can also be used for crawlers, but the advantage with Breadth First Traversal is, depth or levels of the built tree can be limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Social Networking Websites**: In social networks, we can find people within a given distance â€˜kâ€™ from a person using Breadth First Search till â€˜kâ€™ levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **GPS Navigation systems**: Breadth First Search is used to find all neighboring locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) **Broadcasting in Network**: In networks, a broadcasted packet follows Breadth First Search to reach all nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) **In Garbage Collection**: Breadth First Search is used in copying garbage collection using Cheneyâ€™s algorithm. Refer this and for details. Breadth First Search is preferred over Depth First Search because of better locality of reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "8) **Cycle detection in undirected graph**: In undirected graphs, either Breadth First Search or Depth First Search can be used to detect cycle. In directed graph, only depth first search can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) **Fordâ€“Fulkerson algorithm**: In Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, we can either use Breadth First or Depth First Traversal to find the maximum flow. Breadth First Traversal is preferred as it reduces worst case time complexity to O(VE2).\n",
    "\n",
    "10) **To test if a graph is Bipartite**: We can either use Breadth First or Depth First Traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "11) **Path Finding**: We can either use Breadth First or Depth First Traversal to find if there is a path between two vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "12) **Finding all nodes within one connected component**: We can either use Breadth First or Depth First Traversal to find all nodes reachable from a given node."
